## Project Description
This project involves building a customer churn prediction app with Gradio. The app uses a trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a customer churning based on their input data.

How the app works
- The app takes custoner data from users
- The app then prepare and preprocess the data using functions and pipelines
- The app then predict the liklihood of a customer churning by assigning probabilities to **Yes** and **No**.
-  The app  uses the streamlit metric property to display the sale.
## Setup
Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository using:
